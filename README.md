# Fae_Graphics
The all new way to make a 2D game.


This library includes both JFrame creation, which uses the monitor's resolution and soon a customizable resolution, as well as a scale system
This scaling system is adaptable so your program will look EXACTLY the same on any monitor resolution, as long as the aspect ratio does not change

TODO: add new aspect ratios.
